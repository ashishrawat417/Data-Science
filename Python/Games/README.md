Naughts and Crosses game (aka Tic-Tac-Toe) is a well-known and very simple two-player game. The game consists of a playing grid (3x3 or higher) and two players. The playing grid has a set of squares. The squares will be filled by the players. The two players are known as the Naughts player which will be detonated as ”O” and the Crosses player which will be denoted as ”X”. The
playing rules are:
• The Naughts player plays with ”O”.
• The Crosses player plays with ”X”.
• Players take turns by placing ”O” or ”X” on the playing grid square.
• Only one player can play at a time- either ”O” or ”X”.
• The player makes their selection by entering the location of grid square they want to go (the square they want to fill)
• If any of the two players have filled a grid square, then the other player and the same player cannot filled that square.
• If any player gets three of their marks (”O” or ”X”.) on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, this player will be the winner.
• When the playing grid square fills up with neither player winning, the game terminates with no winner.
